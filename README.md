# Womanium-Project---QML-for-MS-
Quantum Machine Learning for Lesion detection in Multiple Sclerosis 

Future Improvements:     
-Bigger Feature Space                             
-MS + other types of lesions
-Changing '0, 1' to labels of healthy vs lesion
-Using other dependencies e.g, pennylane, pyquil
