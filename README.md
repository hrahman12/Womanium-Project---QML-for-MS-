# Womanium-Project---QML-for-MS-
Quantum Machine Learning for Lesion detection in Multiple Sclerosis 

Future Improvements:     
-Bigger Feature Space                             
-MS + other types of lesions    
-Changing '0, 1' to labels of healthy vs lesion  
-Using other dependencies e.g, pennylane, pyquil  
-Defining subtypes e.g PP(Primary Progressive), SP(Secondary Progressive), RR(Relapsing Remitting) and CI (Clinically Isolated)
